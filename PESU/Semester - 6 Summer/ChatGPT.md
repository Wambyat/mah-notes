## Monday

We'll build some chatbot that takes a movie suggestion and builds a synopsis. This is course material. Marks should be from another project.

A few different LLMs:

* GPT-3

* BERT: Google's

* XLNET: Canegie Mellon + Google

* T5: Google's. Specializes in text to text Transformer specializes in translating to another language.

* RoBERTa: Facebook's improvement on BERT.

* BLOOM: The first multi lingual LLM.

PROMPT, an acronym for PROMPTS for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets.

AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

## Tuesday

Stupid index.html. 

* DALL-E: image

* Whisperer: Audio to text

OpenAI has a few different models.

| Name    | About                                                                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Davinci | This is the "main " one that ChatGPT uses. More detail oriented.                               |
| Curie   | Like Davinci but less detail oriented.                                                         |
| Babbage | Curie like but faster and capable of straightforward talks.                                    |
| Ada     | Fastest and lowest cost.                                                                       |
| Codex   | Deprecated. This is the Natural language to code convertor. Like the comment stuff in copilot. |
| TOOLS   | This gives a list of models and lets you uses em.                                              |
| Whisper | Audio to text.                                                                                 |

## Wednesday

Refactoring :).  Zero shot approach is basically no training by user and no real classification. Few shot is doing a little training and a little bit of classification.

## Thursday

## Friday

Exam n proj

## Project

Check promise, async n all. Check a few frameworks. Ignore ajax.

Run http-server so that the JS file is loaded or view inside VSCode's thingy.
