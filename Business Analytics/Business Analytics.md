# Business Analytics

There is a few things to remember when we make a visualization.

- Known Purpose: We should know **why** each object is present in the visualization.

- Ensure integrity: Do not represent data in a way that does not distort the truth. 

- Maximize data ink and minimize non data ink: Make sure that the data is as well and as much represented as possible. Try to not waste ink on things that are not data.

- Annotate your data: Make the data more readable. If a bar graph has a scale but not data marking, it is hard to see the values of the bars.

When we decide to visualize data we should:

1. What do I want to communicate?

2. How do I communicate it? What form?

3. How do I design it so that it is easy to understand the purpose and data?

Which graph do we use?

Use annotations rather than a legend. Don't hesitate for a descriptive title.

### Dashboard

It is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one of more objectives that has been consolidated on a single screen so it can be monitored and understood at a glance. 

A dashboard doe snot have to be "interactive". Its often better if it is not.
