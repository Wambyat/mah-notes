Renne Janseen -> Founder

Marcela Lopez -> good to bad

People first is for refocusing from short term to long term.

Expo new client and new stuff. Software is new.

Marcela was a bitch so Renne had a survey. psychological safety was most important.

Jigar agarwal was a good source. No comuunication and decitions without the team's consent. Lopez alos did everything. If someone was below Lopez's expectations the lopez would just do it herserlf.

Lopez just gave excuses. Alos involved charles. Legally bad. Still deflecting.

Charles said he was asked. He did not demand.
