### Suraj introduces the question “What are any in-demand skills for our company/market sector, and are there any new trends or opportunities we should watch out for in our field?”

Answer: Technology as a whole still has a lot of expansion left in almost all sectors. Right now AI is hot, product development and business understanding and business skills are always in demand. Blockchain and cyber security are areas that are coming up. Main advise is to go deep into a topic and pursue their interests mainly. W.r.t soft skills its not only physically how u present yourself but it is also your depth of knowledge, applicability of what you speak and so many other things. It is essential to have them. 50% is your "hard" tech skills and 50% is your soft skills. The soft helps help a lot in the workplace in building a person's career. A secondary resource we had  from Enterra solutions also reflect this sentiment with Deloitte estimating that almost 2/3rds of jobs will depends on soft skills.

### Prakar introduces “Do educational qualifications matter? (Fresher v/s work professional)”

Answer: Nothing

### Last question - “How can individuals maintain personal growth during tough economic times, and are you exploring any new hobbies or interests as a way to cope with these challenges? Key skills for navigating a recession? What are effective strategies for professionals to improve skills during a recession?”

Answer: Focus on your strengths. It will come in use one day. It is similar to investments. A strong stock will pay out in the long run. Keeping up with the market and link our skills together. They will make sure that you will stay relevant in the work force.
Answer 2: W.r.t staying flexible. Start with your strengths during the start of your career. If you make any changes in your career you should keep all the things in mind before you commit to a change. Not to the point of being inflexible. It will take time to understand the balance so that you understand how to grab the correct opportunities. An article on LinkedIn also listed adaptability as a key skill in navigating tough economic times. Another important aspect that taking a "wrong" turn in your career is not a problem. It's much more important to learn, understand and change because of the wrong turn.
