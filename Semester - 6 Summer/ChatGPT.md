| Davinci | THis is the "main " one that CHatGPT uses. More detail oriented.                               |
| Codex   | Deprecated. This is the Natural language to code convertor. Like the comment stuff in copilot. |
| TOOLS   | GIves a list of models and lets you uses em.                                                   |
| Curie   | Like Davinci but less detail oriented.                                                         |
